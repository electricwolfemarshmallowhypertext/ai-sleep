## Overview

Current AI systems operate in a continuous present without offline reflection, resulting in stateless architectures that cannot maintain identity or learn from experience across sessions. AI Sleep Constructs addresses this fundamental limitation by implementing engineered sleep cycles—inspired by biological sleep—that enable AI systems to consolidate memory, detect and heal from anomalies, and maintain persistent identity.

This framework provides concrete implementations of:
- **Light Sleep Mode**: Rapid maintenance including gradient clipping, attention head pruning, and KV cache management
- **Deep Sleep Mode**: Comprehensive self-healing via diagnostics, semantic consolidation, layer norm recalibration, security patching, and adaptive learning
- **Contextual Triggering**: Intelligent decision logic based on performance drift, anomalies, system load, and user activity
